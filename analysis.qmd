# Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected countries around the world, with varying degrees of severity[@Ioannidis2020]. One key factor in controlling the spread of COVID-19 is vaccination rate[@Muttappallymyalil2022]. It is crucial for the general public to understand the relationship between vaccination and COVID-19 cases so that they can be more proactive in receiving COVID-19 vaccines[@Sallam2021]. This analysis explores the relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases and vaccination rates across several countries in South America. By examining this relationship, we aim to gain insights into the potential impact of vaccinations on the spread of COVID-19.

This data is achieved from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus).

# Data Processing

1.  Use *filter* function to select countries in Sorth America.
2.  Use *select* function to select columns needed for the analysis.
3.  Use *group_by* and *summarize* function to group the data by location and month, and to select data about case, death and vaccination.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)

covid <- read_csv("owid-covid-data.csv")

south_america <- covid %>%
  filter(continent %in% "South America")

clean_data <- south_america %>%
  select(location, date, new_cases_per_million, new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_million)

by_month <- clean_data %>%
  group_by(location, date = as.Date(paste(format(date, "%Y"), format(date, "%m"), "01", sep = "-"))) %>%
  summarize(
    monthly_cases_percent = sum(new_cases_per_million, na.rm = TRUE),
    monthly_new_vaccination_percent = sum(new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_million, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

# Trend of COVID-19 Cases in South America

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

cases <- ggplot(data = by_month, mapping = aes(x = date, y = monthly_cases_percent, color = location)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Monthly COVID-19 Case Trends by Country in South America",
    subtitle = "Tracking changes in COVID-19 cases over time across different countries in South America",
    x = "Time",
    y = "Monthly Cases per Million"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~ location, scales = "free_x") +  
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
cases

```

# COVID-19 Vaccination in South America

```{r}
vaccination <- ggplot(data = by_month, aes(x = location, y = monthly_new_vaccination_percent, fill = location)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  labs(
    title = "COVID-19 Vaccination Dosage by Country",
    subtitle = "Summarizing COVID-19 vaccination dosage in different countries in South America",
    x = "Country",
    y = "Vaccination Dosage"
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
vaccination
```

::: callout-important
Here, vaccination rate refers to the total dosage number of COVID-19 vaccine given per million people.

# Relationship Between Vaccination and COVID-19 Cases in South America

```{r}
vac_sum <- by_month %>%
  group_by(location) %>%
  summarize(total_vaccination = sum(monthly_new_vaccination_percent))

case_sum <- by_month %>%
  group_by(location) %>%
  summarize(total_cases = sum(monthly_cases_percent))

combined <- left_join(vac_sum, case_sum, by = "location")

relationship <- ggplot(data = combined, mapping = aes(x = total_vaccination, y = total_cases, color = location)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Vaccination and New Case in South America",
    subtitle = "There is no apparant relationship between vaccination and COVID-19 case in South America",
    x = "Number of Vaccination",
    y = "Number of COVID-19 Cases"
  ) +
  theme_classic()
relationship
```

# Result

Based on the analysis, we are able to conclude that there is no apparent relationship between vaccination dosage and COVID-19 case in South America. Some countries with moderate vaccination rate, like Venezuela, show low number of COVID-19 cases. On the other hand, some countries with high vaccination rate, like Uruguay, show high number of COVID-19 cases. This might be a result of the difference between policy, culture, and people's attitute towards COVID-19 in each country.

# Function Used for Analysis

Five functions from dplyr or tidyr: filter(), group_by(), summarize(), select(), left_join().

Three geom\_() functions: geom_line(), geom_bar(), geom_point().
